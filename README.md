# Network Attack Prediction

## Project Details:
**Domain**: Machine Learning                  
**Project Name**: Network Attacks Prediction

## Data Description:
It is a multi-class classification problem. The dataset contains 41 feature columns and 1 label column. The task is to classify the data into 5 types of network attacks, namely:-                 
1)ipsweep probe                             
2)back dos                                 
3)satan probe                              
4)portsweep probe                                
5)normal

## Results:
We tried a differnet types of models. We tried Logistic Regression, Random Forest and Gradient Boosting Classifier. In the end we found that, the data trained on Random Forest give the best testing result with an accuracy of 99.9%
